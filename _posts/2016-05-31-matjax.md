### Taylor Series

Considering the function \\(y = f(x)\\) has its \\(n + 1\\) derivatives, in the interval of (\\(x\\) containing the point \\(x = x_0\\). One can find the polynomium  \\(y= P(x)\\) (or the sum of a power series) of degree smaller than \\(n\\), such as its value in \\(x=x_0\\) be smaller or equal to the funcion in this point, and the values of its derivatives are not greather than n in  \\(x =x_0\\) be equal to the values of the derivatives of \\(f(x)\\) in this point. When one finds the polynomium it is an approximation of the function \\(f(x)\\) to a polynomium \\(P(x)\\).

In order to obtain the polynomium \\(P(x)\\) which will provide us the approximation to \\(f(x)\\), we shall use the following expression:

\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:taylor1}
y = f(x) = f(x_0)+ \\int_{x_0}^{x} \\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x_0)+
\\int_{x_0}^{x} f'(x)dx
\\end{equation}


\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:taylor2}
I = \\int_{x_0}^{x} f'(x)dx
\\end{equation}

This way, we have to find the value of the integral of the derivative of \\(f(x)\\) in order to get the value of the approximation of the function that we aim to find.

i) The first approximation that we can make is to think of the function \\(y = f(x)\\) as a constant equal to \\(f(x_0)\\), where \\(f(x_0)\\) is the value of the function  \\(y\\) at \\(ax = ax_0\\), i.e., considering the value of the integral \\ref{eq:taylor2} to be zero.
